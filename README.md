# Traffic-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
Using public traffic dataset from MMDA, I used Jupyter Notebooks to do ETL and Power BI to visualize the data.

Objectives:
This study aims to:
1. Gain a comprehensive understanding of traffic patterns in major roads in the Philippines based on the MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) Annual Average Daily Traffic report.
2. Systematically identify and characterize the top congestion hotspots within a specified major road.
3. Discern the predominant vehicle categories that dominate the local roadways.
4. Assess the performance of existing transportation services, including public transit, road networks, and traffic management strategies.
   
II. Problem Statement:
The Philippines is currently grappling with a transportation landscape burdened by substantial challenges stemming from rapid urbanization and a surge in vehicular traffic. The burgeoning population, coupled with increased motorization, has led to congested roadways, prolonged commute times, environmental concerns, and economic repercussions. To address these issues effectively, it is imperative to obtain a comprehensive understanding of traffic patterns, congestion hotspots, predominant vehicle categories, and the performance of existing transportation services. This necessitates a thorough analysis of the MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) report.

III. Background:
The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) in the Philippines is a government agency responsible for coordinating and overseeing various aspects of development, traffic management, urban planning, and public services within the Metro Manila region. One of the primary roles of the MMDA is to manage and regulate traffic flow in Metro Manila. This includes implementing traffic rules and regulations, coordinating road repairs and maintenance, and developing strategies to address congestion and improve overall traffic management.
The MMDA collects traffic data from various sources, which may include traffic count stations, automated traffic monitoring systems, surveillance cameras, and other data collection methods placed strategically across major roads and intersections in Metro Manila. The collected data is aggregated and organized to create a comprehensive dataset that contains information on traffic volume and vehicle types for different road segments and intersections.
Yearly, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) publishes a report called Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). These reports, which can be found in the MMDA website, contains the volume of vehicles traversing the Philippine major roads since 2012 up to 2022. The roads included on the report are both the radial roads (R:1 , R:2, R:3, R:4, R:5, R:6, R:7, R:8, R:9, R:10, Marcos Highway, McArthur Highway) and the circumferential roads (C:1, C:2, C:3, C:4, C:5, and C:6). This report is a tangible metric showing the level of vehicular congestion along a given route. It also shows the volume of vehicles by category specifically cars, trucks, trailers, motorcycles, tricycles, taxis, public utility jeeps (PUJ), utility vehicles (UV), and public utility buses (PUB) passing through the roads.
The Philippines is notorious for its severe traffic congestion, especially in major urban centers like Metro Manila. Traffic jams are a daily occurrence, leading to significant productivity loss and heightened stress levels for commuters. This Business Intelligence project delves into an in-depth analysis of the Philippine Average Daily Traffic (ADT) patterns aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the countryâ€™s transportation dynamics and infrastructure utilization.

IV. Data Source:
The AADT data used in this analysis was sourced directly from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), a governmental organization responsible for traffic management and urban planning in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines. The dataset includes detailed information on traffic volume, road types, and other relevant variables. Access to the dataset was obtained through the MMDA's Freedom of Information (FOI) initiative, which promotes transparency and data accessibility. The data is collected through an extensive network of traffic monitoring systems strategically placed across key roadways and intersections within Metropolitan Manila. These monitoring systems use various technologies such as traffic cameras, sensors, and automated counting mechanisms to capture real-time traffic data. The dataset covers a comprehensive period from 2012 to 2021. This duration encompasses 10 years of traffic data, allowing for a detailed analysis of traffic patterns and trends over an extended period. The AADT data was provided in a tabular format, most likely in a commonly used format such as Comma-Separated Values (CSV) or Excel spreadsheets. Each record in the dataset represents a specific location and date, along with associated traffic volume and relevant attributes. Upon obtaining the raw data, initial preprocessing steps were performed to clean and transform the data for analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing variable formats, and potentially deriving additional features to enhance the analysis. It is important to note that while the dataset provides valuable insights into traffic patterns, there may be inherent limitations such as occasional gaps in data due to technical issues or changes in monitoring infrastructure.
